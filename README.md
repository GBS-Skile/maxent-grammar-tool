# MaxEnt Grammar Tool

> Demo is available: [https://teamcrsd.uc.r.appspot.com/](https://teamcrsd.uc.r.appspot.com/)

**MaxEnt Grammar**, short for Maximum Entropy Grammar, is a probabilistic approach to phonology that aims to model the distribution of phonological patterns in language.
It employs the principle of maximum entropy to predict the likelihood of different phonological structures occurring based on their constraints and probabilities.

This web service helps linguists analyze language patterns using Tableaux-form data.
It calculates weights to show which factors are most important and predicts probabilities for different outcomes.

### TODO

- [ ] Input file validation
- [ ] Verification of consistency
- [ ] Initial vector given by user
- [ ] Inline modification (Tableaux, constraints)
- [ ] More visualization (e.g. LaTeX rendering)
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning (especially about optimization technique)
